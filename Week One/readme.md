#The Plant Keeper

A stylish, useful machine to make sure your plant gets the water and sunlight it needs. This ceramic pot includes built-in light sensors on the inner, uppermost part of the pot, as well as water sensors in the sides of the pot.

 An initial scan of the plant allows the sensors to process the colors of the plant and from there create a set of parameters. When the sensors "see" the colors of the plant within the parameters, the plant is not straining itself to find light. Once the colors are spotted outside the parameters, the yellow button will begin flashing, indicating for the user to push the button. Upon activation of the yellow button, the pot rotates 180 degrees on a track built into the plate.

 Sensors within the walls of the pot detect water levels every 24 hours. Once a particular threshold for dryness is met, the blue light begins blinking. This signals the user to press the button. Water is released from the lip of the pot, where a water storage area is built within. It is recommended to replaced water supply every 1-2 months.

 An additional green button is available on select models, which would act similarly to the water button, except it would release plant food into the pot.
